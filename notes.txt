Session - 008
JWT- 
if u want to route privately for e.g. you dont want to give access to all users to run the app without login
the we need to set the route as private and user will send a token known as JavaScript Web Token(JWT) with requests

I was having the same issue, what fixed it for me was editing my package.json file, and under scripts: {

"build": "webpack -d && copy src\\index.html dist\\index.html /y && webpack-dev-server --content-base src --inline --port 3000"
body-parser
it is used to put req to post method, so whenever we want to send data to the post we access it with req.body
e.g. req.body.email

JWT and passport JWT
JWT is simply the token when allows the user but
Passport JWt is used to validate and extracts the user info from it
bearer token- certain type of protocol

Error response
res.status(404).json(errors)
